# ChatbotChatroom
Using Python Scripting, I created a way for two chat bots to communicate back and forth with one another.

My first ever web based python scripting project using selenium! Using Mitsuku (https://www.pandorabots.com/mitsuku/), I set up two of them to communicate with each other back and forth. It was a fun project for learning the basics of web scripting!
